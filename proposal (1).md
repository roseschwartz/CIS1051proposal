# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pong

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A game of traditional pong, except the opponent increasingly gets more advantages (paddle grows and increased ball speed)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

To execute, we will follow the pong game track from CS50. That game track uses LOVE to execute the game and LUA as the programming language. This game will follow the traditional rules of pong, but the opponent will return the ball to the player at an increasing velocity the longer the game goes on. We will also implement another advantage for the opponent that increases the size of their paddle as the game progresses, making it exponentially harder for the player.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, we will accomplish a functional game of traditional pong. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome, would mean we would have a functional game of pong and added sound effects working as well. Parts of the advantages will function as well. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for the final project would be a functional game of pong with all the added bells and whistles. This would include sound effects and all the advantages functioning for the opponent. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Our next step is to follow the track that is set up by CS50. There will be many new skills needed in order to complete the project. We will need to learn how to use LUA and LOVE together in order to make it work. These are two applications that are new. We will have to research how to use LUA as a programming language. Both of us will follow the video series together, forming the structure of the code together. Towards the end, each of us will likely work on one of the specific bonuses to the game that we are implementing beyond the requirements.
